# Expenses-tracker-App
#Technologies
For an Asp.Net MVC solution 
• ASP.Net MVC
• Entity Framework
• SQL Server
• JQuery
• Bootstrap

TASK:
Utilizing a code first approach, build an Expenses Tracking app that will:
1. List existing expenses
2. Provide a method to Add a new expense
3. Provide a method to Edit an existing expense
4. Provide a method to Delete an existing expense
Discussion:
We have a client that wants us to build a simple and easy to use entry form to capture expenses, and assign
them to an existing customer and a specific project of that customer. The customer has an existing application
in C#/MVC and we need to stay consistent with their current programming model. There is no need for any
special graphics or css, but neatness and nice design is a must; therefore, bootstrap will be used as the primary
css layout.
