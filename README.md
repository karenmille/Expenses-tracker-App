TASK:
Utilizing a code first approach, build an Expenses Tracking app that will:
1. List existing expenses
2. Provide a method to Add a new expense
3. Provide a method to Edit an existing expense
4. Provide a method to Delete an existing expense
Discussion:
We have a client that wants us to build a simple and easy to use entry form to capture expenses, and assign
them to an existing customer and a specific project of that customer. The customer has an existing application
in C#/MVC and we need to stay consistent with their current programming model. There is no need for any
special graphics or css, but neatness and nice design is a must; therefore, bootstrap will be used as the primary
css layout.
It must be an easy to use interface, as we are not supplying a user-manual to the client for this simple job. All
entry validation and error-handling must be included to make sure we never show the user an unhandled
error. There will be a delete function, and we must show the dialog box to make sure this is what the user
wants to do. 
The expense record should be physically deleted from The listing form will initially pull all expenses ordered by the Date, Company, and Project and display them in a
grid. Each line item will have an Edit and Delete link associated with it.the database upon confirmation.
There are two simple forms – a listing form, and an entry form.
